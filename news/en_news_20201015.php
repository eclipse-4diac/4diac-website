<p>PS: With Eclipse 4diac 1.13.0 the 4diac IDE requires at least Java 11 installed on your machine! 
If you download the official 4diac IDE package a correct Java version is already included.
Many thanks to the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/justj/" >Eclipse JustJ project</a> for that support.</p>
