<p>Eclipse 4diacâ„¢ was presented at the Eclipse DemoCamp in Munich on December 5<sup>th</sup>. 
An introduction to its capabilities was followed by the demonstration of a 3D-printed prototype of a un/stacker module controlled by an 
IndraControl XM22 PLC from Bosch Rexroth. 
The PLC received the commands from an HMI and sent its states back using MQTT messages, 
allowing the user to see in real-time the process steps of the prototype.</p>
