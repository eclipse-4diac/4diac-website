<p>We just uploaded the presentations given at this year's <a href="https://eclipse.dev/4diac/en_workshop_2015.php" rel="nofollow">4DIAC Users' Workshop</a>. As in the last years we had a great program with presentations covering topics like cyber security, formal verification and how to manage external events in 4DIAC, to name only some examples. </p>

<p>In addition to the presentation the afternoon session featured great discussions on using 4DIAC and open points in its development. Furthermore we gave a sneak preview on the upcoming features like the new system perspective layout, the improved application palette and the great new ECC editor. 
</p>

<p>We are already looking forward to the next users' workshop.</p>
