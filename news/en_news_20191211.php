<p>A skill provides a generic description of an automation component functionalities. 
Such a description is an important prerequisite for the implementation of the changeability required in the context of Industry 4.0. 
The main purpose of defining a skill is to design the automation systems based on the required skills for each step of a production process, instead of identifying actual production resources. 
A working group within VDMA is currently working on standardizing a skill interface as OPC UA companion specification.</p> 

<p>You are welcome to develop your own PLC skills and build your own experiments.</p>
