<p>It is hard to believe that 15 years have passed since on July 7<sup>th</sup>, 
2007 the first public 4diac version was presented by Thomas Strasser and Alois Zoitl at the <a href="http://www.ieee-ies.org/">IEEE IES</a> International Conference on Industrial Informatics. 
</p>

<p>In these 15 years, the development of Eclipse 4diac had its ups and downs - but nowadays it is used by universities and research institutions all over the globe. 
And, increasingly, even companies are using or investigating 4diac for their use cases. 
<a href="https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/staff/mmm/">Martin Melik-Merkumians (ACIN, TU Wien)</a>, a long time Eclipse 4diac committer, summarizes our history: 
<i><q>Being part of the team since 2009, I (well, probably all of us) had the high hopes to make a significant impact to the automation industry and its users with 4diac. 
Although I had never given up this hope, it didn't always look like it in all these years. 
All the more it is pleasing to see now, how we managed to change minds in academia and industry.</q></i></p>

<p>
Already 7 years ago (in 2015), our proposal for an official Eclipse project was accepted. While some developers retired, new ones joined. Currently, we have 8 committers - and many more contributors! 
<i><q>In the past 3.5 years, 4diac IDE has shaped my work, my PhD studies, and my free time: I deeply enjoy developing new features that benefit users of the IDE. 
I am happy to be part of the development community, which welcomed me warmly and is a great network of support.</q></i>,

<p>
In the last years, the maturity of Eclipse 4diac has increased tremendously. 
We implemented numerous improvements and usability enhancements that we did not even dare to dream of 15 years ago. 
This would not been possible without the feedback from our users. 
<a href="https://www.jku.at/lit-cyber-physical-systems-lab/ueber-uns/team/univ-prof-di-dr-alois-zoitl/">Alois Zoitl (LIT CPS Lab, JKU)</a>, 
one of the co-founders and project lead, points it out very nicely: 
<i><q>Many thanks for the feedback from our users and for the fruitful discussion sessions we had in the last 15 years. 
I am looking forward to many more constructive discussions for further improvements to turn Eclipse 4diac into the best IEC 61499 solution.</q></i>
</p>

<p>
Hence, we are looking forward to the next 15 years of Eclipse 4diac!
