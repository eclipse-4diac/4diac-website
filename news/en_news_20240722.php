<p>
<a href="https://www.aimirimsti.com.br/en/solu%C3%A7%C3%B5es">Aimirim</a> would like to anounce what we consider a nice contribution to Eclipse 4diac community.
The <a href="https://github.com/Aimirim-STI/4diac-Plugin-UAORT">UAORT plug-in</a> is a lighthouse towards configurabilty in IEC 61499 by allowing 4diac IDE users deploy to the UAO (Universal Automation) run-time environment.
</p>
<p>
We understood that UAO is growing and the demand for this configurabilty is growing also.
Aimirim has deployed several complex real world industrial applications using Eclipse 4diac. 
This allowed us to understand the advantanges of event driven distributed applications and opensource models to speed up industry 4.0 revolution.
This experience also make it easier for us to do this job and contribute to the Eclipse 4diac comunity. 
</p>
<p>
That's why we did that, focused on the main goal of unlocking the digitization of industrial operations.
Aimirim believes that the growth of this market will drive more opportunities to startups and new talents.
Contributing to Eclipse 4diac also represents this belief.
</p>

<p>Cheers,
	<br>Aimirim Team </p>
