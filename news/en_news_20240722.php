<p>
<a href="https://www.aimirimsti.com.br/en/solu%C3%A7%C3%B5es">Aimirim</a> would like to anounce what we consider a nice contribution to 4DIAC community.
The <a href="https://github.com/Aimirim-STI/4diac-Plugin-UAORT">UAORT plug-in</a> is a lighthouse toward interoperability in IEC61499 allowing 4DIAC users deploy on UAO (Universal Automation) runtime.
</p>
<p>
We understood that UAO is growing and the demand for this interoperability is growing also.
Aimirim has deployed several complex real world industrial applications using 4DIAC what allowed us to understand the advantanges of event driven distributed applications and opensource models to speed up industry 4.0 revolution.
This experience also make it easier for us to do this job and contribute with the comunity. 
</p>
<p>
That's why we did that, focused on the main goal of unlocking the digitization of industrial operations.
Aimirim believes that the growth of this market will drive more opportunities to startups and new talents.
Contributing to 4DIAC also represents this belief.

<p>Cheers,
